# Hydrate

An open source Android application to allow a user to help track water intake (or lack thereof).

This application currently exists on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frankcalise.h2droid).

In an effort to work on my Android/Java skills, as well as to become more involved here in the social coding scene, I am moving this project from Google Code to GitHub. Since I plan on remodeling this application quite a bit, I probably won't migrate the project over straight from Google Code.

All feedback is welcome and hopefully I can create an even better application for my current audience. This started as just a hobby but many people enjoy the app and are pushing me to develop it further.
